Here's a recap of what we've covered in this course:

1. **Fundamentals:** We explored the importance of containers, the evolution of virtualization, underlying Linux technologies, and Docker's role.
2. **Using Containers:** We used public third-party containers for databases and interactive test environments.
3. **Building a Multi-Service Web Application:** We containerized a web application and established a smooth development workflow.
4. **Deploying to the Cloud:** We deployed our application to the cloud using Docker Swarm.

## Bonus content!

As mentioned during the deployment section of the course, I filmed two additional videos, one covering deploying the sample application to [https://railway.app](https://railway.app/) and another deploying to Kubernetes running on [Civo cloud](https://www.civo.com/).

These can be found at: [https://links.devopsdirective.com/docker-gumroad](https://links.devopsdirective.com/docker-gumroad)

These are "pay what you want" with a minimum of $1 (required by Gumroad since the video files are above 250MB). If you got value from the course and want to pay more than the minimum that is great, but if you can't afford to do so, that's okay too!
